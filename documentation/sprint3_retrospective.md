# Sprint 3 Retrospective
Sprint 3: 7 - 13 January 2020
Retrospective: 14 January 2020
Participants: Elin Andersson Bj√∂rnetorp, Trupti Gaonkar, Basel Munawwar, Ayumi Nakamura

## What went well during Sprint 3 and for the whole project period
- We could finish developing our application.
- We helped each other technically.
- We could be agile in how we worked, and adapted our tasks and responsibilities accordingly.
- We learned how to use issues, pull requests and projects on github.
- Good job teammates!

## What needs to be improved
- We should have divided our issues into much smaller parts so that our branches, commits and pull requests do not have to include the whole backend, for example.
- As it is difficult to know the details of each tasks from the beginning, we should have updated issues more frequently.
- For the next project, we should improve the way we communicate. We should not skipp dailys.
- We should notify the changes in directory structure to everyone as soon as possible in order to avoid merge conflicts in the future.
